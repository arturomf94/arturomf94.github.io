I'm part of the SMPC team at [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/). I also work at [Bitso](https://bitso.com/), doing data stuff. 

I'm mostly interested in calm, privacy-enhancing technologies, but also in developing, deploying and monitoring machine learning models to production environments (i.e. MLOps).

This is not a contradiction.
