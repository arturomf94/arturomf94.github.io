I am very proud to announce that `bitso-rs` is now an official API client in Bitso's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/bitsoex/).

You can find the official repository [here](https://github.com/bitsoex/bitso-rs/).

_Note: my prebious, [personal repository](https://github.com/arturomf94/bitsors) has now been archived but the usage of the crate will remain the same._
