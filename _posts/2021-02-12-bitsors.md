A little before joining Bitso I decided to pick-up an easy project to learn some Rust. I figured it would be cool to take advantage of the implicit synergy by creating a wrapper of [Bitso's API](https://bitso.com/api_info) with Rust.

I managed to get a fair support for both the public and the private API, but left lots of pending issues. Recently, [Bruno A. Muci√±o](https://mucinoab.github.io/) made some contributions to it that have inspired me to pick it up again. 

Hopefully, we will manage to add support for WebSockets soon!

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/arturomf94/bitsors), the crate [here](https://crates.io/crates/bitsors) and the docs [here](https://docs.rs/bitsors).
