### DIY Pub Beer-Garden Table

List of things I still need to buy:

* 1 box of deck-scews - 3-1/2" long (maybe even 4" long). This
  should have at least more than 50 screws.
* 1 box of deck-screws - 2" long. This should have at least
  more than 50 screws.
* 12: 3/8" x 2" lag bolts with washers and nuts for the table
  cleats.
* 6: 3/8" x 2-1/2" lag scews with washers.
